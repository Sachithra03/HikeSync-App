    <string name="description">"Great trail that starts through a tea plantation. The trail is easier in the beginning but then it will eventually become quite steep. Keep pushing to reach the top as the views are well worth it. You will be able to see the entire city of Ella as well as Little Adam's Peak. Bring plenty of water. The entire steep climb is in the forest so there are plenty of shade."</string>
